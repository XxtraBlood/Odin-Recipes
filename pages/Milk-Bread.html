                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Make the tangzhong by heating up milk in a small pot. Stir in bread flour
                        until a thick paste forms. Pour paste into a medium bowl. Add 1/2 cup milk
                        and beaten egg; mix well.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place flour and yeast in a large mixing bowl. Mix with a spatula or by hand.
                        Pour in tangzhong mixture. Stir well with a spatula until no dry spots remain.
                        Gather dough in the middle of the bowl. Cover with a damp towel. Let rest for 20 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add salt to the dough and knead until incorporated. Repeat with sugar, 1 tablespoon
                        at a time. Knead until dough is smooth, about 10 minutes. Add butter; keep kneading
                        until evenly incorporated and dough is smooth.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Form dough into a ball and place into a well oiled bowl. Turn dough to grease on all sides.
                        Let proof at room temperature until doubled, about 1 hour.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Turn dough out onto a clean work surface and deflate it. Press gently into a rectangle; roll
                        up into a cylinder and transfer to a loaf pan. Let loaf proof until doubled, about 1 hour.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place loaf pan on the middle rack of the preheated oven and reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees
                        F (175 degrees C). Bake until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes before inverting
                        onto a cooling rack. Cool completely before slicing.
